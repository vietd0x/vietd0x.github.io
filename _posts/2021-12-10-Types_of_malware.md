Here are the categories that most malware falls into;

## **Backdoor**
malicious code that installs itself onto a computer to allow the attacker access. Backdoors usually let the attacker connect to the computer with little or no authentication and execute commands on the local system.

## **Botnet**
Similar to a backdoor, in that it allows the attacker access to the system, but all computers infected with the same botnet receive the same instructions from a single command-and-control server.

## **Downloader**
Malicious code that exists only to download other malicious code. Downloaders are commonly installed by attackers when they first gain access to a system. The downloader program will download and install additional malicious code.

## **Infomation-stealing malware**
Malware that collects info from a victim's computer and usually sends it to the attacker. Ex: include sniffers, password hash grabbers, and keyloggers. This malware is typically used to gain access to online accounts such as email or online banking.

## **Launcher**
Malicious program used to lauch other malicious programs. Usually, launchers use nontraditional techniques to launch other malicious programs in order to ensure stealth or greater access to a system.

## **Rootkit**
Malicious code designed to conceal the existence of other code. Rootkits are usually paired with other malware, such as a backoor, to allow remote access to attacker and make code difficult for the victim to detect.

## **Scareware**
Malware designed to frighten an infected user into buying something. It usually has a user interface that makes it look like an anitivirus or other security program. It informs users that there is malicious code on their system and that the only way to get rid of it is to buy their "software". when in reality, the software it's selling does nothing more than remove the scareware.

## **Spam-sending malware**
Malware that infects a user's machine and then uses that machine to send spam. This malware generates income for attackers by allowing them to sell spam-sending services.

## **Worm or virus**:
Malicious code that can copy itself and infect additional computers.
